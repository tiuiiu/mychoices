    <ul>
    <li style="font-family:verdana; font-size:150%;">This is a British dystopia SF anthology TV drama series. It was planned by Charlie Brooker. Until season 2, it aired on Channel 4 in the UK, and from season 3, it will be produced and released on Netflix.</li>
    <br><li style="font-family:verdana; font-size:150%">What are the side effects of technology if it is the same as drugs and is used as drugs? The ambiguous thing between anxiety and pleasure is the black mirror. The "black mirror" in the title is on all walls and desks and on everyone's palm: a cold, flashing television screen, monitor, and smartphone are the "black mirror."
- Charlie Brooker's interview in The Guardian.</li>
    <br><li style="font-family:verdana; font-size:150%;">It deals with the negative aspects of media and information technology development when it precedes human ethics. Media is often used as an expression of a mirror that illuminates the times, and it is derived from the fact that when the electronic device "black mirror" is turned off, the person's face is reflected on the black screen, and it is a title that implies the theme of the drama well.</li>
    <br><li style="font-family:verdana; font-size:150%;">SF omnibus dramas are similar to strange stories and fantasy expressions, but as mentioned above, the focus is on the theme of side effects of media and information technology development. In addition, even SF, which is set in the near future, has almost the same human attire and lifestyle as it is now, and features a description of a more advanced technology that is "protecting a feasible level" and a description of a situation that may occur under that technology.</li>
